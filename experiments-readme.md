# Experiments README

## Summary of Learnings

This notebook covers comprehensive experiment setup and execution in LangSmith, including running evaluations on RAG applications with different models, dataset versions, splits, and configuration parameters like concurrency and repetitions.

## Code Tweaks

Modified the conciseness evaluator to use character count instead of word count and implemented dynamic experiment naming based on model configuration, plus added custom metadata tracking for performance comparison across different runs.
